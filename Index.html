	<p>The purpose of the handlebars is threefold; provide a mechanism
	to steer the bicycle, second provide balance and stability as you ride,
	and third provide a comfortable place for your hands.</p>
	
	<p>The first two purposes are straightforward and most handlebars address
	these needs, however the need for comfort is more difficult to achieve.</p>
	
	<p>Many people will use the handlebars that came stock on their bicycles
	and never give a second thought to changing them.  As an individual spends
	more time and duration on their bicycle, comfort becomes an important factor.
	Handlebar comfort can fall into; primary hand position, number of alternative
	hand positions, grips, tape, padding, weight distribution, and body position.</p>
